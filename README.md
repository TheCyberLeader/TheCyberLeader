## 👋 Welcome

Born to immigrant parents and raised in Detroit, Michigan, I learned resilience early through financial hardship and community change. Today, I’m a **cybersecurity and governance executive** with 15+ years of experience building high-performing teams, embedding compliance-by-design, and translating regulations into strategies that enable business goals and reduce risk.  

My leadership is **rooted in resilience, powered by people, and focused on creating lasting impact** across industries.

## 📸 Resilience & Leadership in Action
Leadership is shaped not only in boardrooms but through lived experiences. From childhood, I learned resilience and imagination. My executive vision board reflects the discipline of aligning strategy with purpose, while my advocacy for women in cybersecurity underscores my commitment to equity and representation. Standing at NJIT, preparing to lecture on Cyber and AI marks the transition from student to thought leader, reinforcing my belief that knowledge is meant to be shared. Together, these moments define a leadership style grounded in resilience, advocacy, and impact.
