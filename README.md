# 💫 About Me

Born to immigrant parents and raised in Metro Detroit, Michigan, I learned resilience early through financial hardship and community change. Those formative experiences taught me imagination and determination, qualities that continue to guide my work today.

With over 11 years as a cybersecurity and governance executive, I've built my career on a simple belief: security should accelerate business, not slow it down. My work focuses on translating complex regulations into frameworks that enable transformation, building teams that drive results, and ensuring organizations can innovate with confidence.

My advocacy for women in cybersecurity reflects a core commitment that leadership means creating pathways for others, powered by people and focused on lasting impact across industries.

## 💜 WiCyS Women in Cybersecurity

I'm a member of **[Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS)](https://www.wicys.org/)** and serve on the **Equity Advisory Committee (EAC)** providing strategic counsel to advance equity and inclusion within the cybersecurity community, developing organizational policies, reviewing programs through an equity lens, and delivering quarterly recommendations to the Board of Directors.

### 🎤 Speaking at WiCyS 2026 Washington, DC

</p>

My first WiCyS conference is going to be an unforgettable one, and I'm still pinching myself. I was awarded a scholarship to attend WiCyS 2026, and on March 12th I'll be presenting alongside my amazing EAC colleagues on breaking the invisible barriers that keep underrepresented professionals from reaching leadership in cybersecurity.
This topic is personal to me. I can't wait to be in a room full of people who get it, learning from industry leaders, connecting with fellow professionals, and being part of a community that's actively doing the work.
Thank you to WiCyS and the scholarship sponsors for investing in women in cybersecurity and creating pathways for greater representation in this field. Washington, DC, here we come! 🙌

## 💚 ISC2 New Jersey Chapter Volunteer

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/isc2-nj-chapter-dinner.jpg" alt="ISC2 NJ Chapter" width="400"/> 
</p>

I've been a volunteer with the **[ISC2 New Jersey Chapter](https://isc2chapter-newjersey.org/)** for nearly two years, and joining this community was one of the best professional decisions I've ever made. When I first joined, the chapter was ~400 members strong. Today we've more than doubled in size, and it's not hard to see why.

Cybersecurity isn't just a job. It's a way of life. We think differently, through a lens of risk, resilience, and responsibility. What makes this chapter special is the authentic relationships built on trust and a shared commitment to the profession and to lifting each other up.

### 🤖 Founder, AI Security Working Group

<p align="center">

</p>

I founded the **AI Security Working Group** for the ISC2 NJ Chapter, focused on advancing AI security excellence through collaboration, education, and innovation across the cybersecurity community.

I also participate in the **Mentoring Committee**, helping connect and support the next generation of cybersecurity professionals in New Jersey.

### 🍳 Marie's Recipe Collection

[![Chef Mer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1c3b225-acf5-4aa2-8eec-ba4870e0d295)](https://thecyberleader.github.io/recipes/)

A personal recipe webapp with adjustable servings, a shopping list builder, and nutrition info, built in memory of my Teta (grandmother), who passed away recently and believed deeply that recipes are meant to be shared.

My love of cooking comes from her. She taught me that cooking is more than following instructions, it's about the simple, beautiful rhythms of daily life, thinking of others, and creating something with love. This is my way of honoring her and continuing what she taught me: that food connects us, that cooking is an act of care, and that the best meals are the ones we share.
