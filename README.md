👋 Welcome  

Born to immigrant parents and raised in Detroit, Michigan, I learned resilience early through financial hardship and community change. Today, I’m a **cybersecurity and governance executive** with 15+ years of experience building high-performing teams, embedding compliance-by-design, and translating regulations into strategies that enable business goals and reduce risk.  

My leadership is **rooted in resilience, powered by people, and focused on creating lasting impact** across industries.
