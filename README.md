# 💫 About Me

Born to immigrant parents and raised in Metro Detroit, Michigan, I learned resilience early through financial hardship and community change. Those formative experiences taught me imagination and determination, qualities that continue to guide my work today.

With over 11 years as a cybersecurity and governance executive, I've built my career on a simple belief: security should accelerate business, not slow it down. My work focuses on translating complex regulations into frameworks that enable transformation, building teams that drive results, and ensuring organizations can innovate with confidence.

My advocacy for women in cybersecurity reflects a core commitment that leadership means creating pathways for others, powered by people and focused on lasting impact across industries.

# 🍳 Beyond Cybersecurity
A personal collection of tried and true favorite recipes and culinary experiments, because leadership and security aren't the only things worth cultivating.
Sahtain! (صحتين) - "Two healths" in Arabic. It's what we say when someone is eating or has just finished a meal, wishing them double the health and enjoyment.

# Why This Repo Exists
My love of cooking comes from my Teta (grandmother), who passed away a few months ago. She was an excellent cook and believed deeply that recipes are meant to be shared. Some of my earliest and most treasured memories are of us cooking together in her kitchen. 

She taught me that cooking is more than following instructions; it's about the simple, beautiful rhythms of daily life, thinking of others, and creating something with love. This repo is my way of honoring her and continuing what she taught me: that food connects us, that cooking is an act of care, and that the best meals are the ones we share.
